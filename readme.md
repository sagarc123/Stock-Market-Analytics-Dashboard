Data Flow:

`CSV → ETL (Pandas) → SQLite Database → FastAPI → Dash Dashboard`

### 1️⃣ ETL Layer (src/etl/ingest_to_sqlite.py)

-   Parses and cleans raw CSV data using Pandas.

-   Validates column types, removes inconsistencies, and loads data into SQLite.

-   Ensures schema consistency and avoids duplicates using primary key constraints.

### 2️⃣ API Layer (src/api/app.py)

-   Built with FastAPI for high performance and scalability.

-   Loads data in-memory for faster API responses.

-   Provides RESTful endpoints for metrics, prices, and sector summaries.

-   Uses efficient filtering and aggregation for quick data retrieval.

Key Endpoints:

-   `/metrics/sector_summary` → Aggregated sector-wise metrics

-   `/data/daily_prices` → Company-level daily price data

-   `/health` → System health and data availability check

### 3️⃣ Dashboard Layer (src/dashboard/app.py)

-   Interactive dashboard built using Plotly Dash.

-   Offers multiple analytical tabs:

    -   Overview Tab: High-level KPIs and market trends.

    -   Sectors Tab: Sector-level performance comparisons.

    -   Valuation Tab: Company valuation metrics and ratios.

    -   Comparison Tab: Time-based and metric comparisons.

Visualization Components:

-   Bar charts for rankings and performance

-   Pie charts for sector distributions

-   Scatter plots for metric relationships

-   Line charts for historical trends

-   Heatmaps for correlation analysis
